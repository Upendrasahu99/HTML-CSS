        action
        
      1. action attribute defines the aciton to be performed when the form is submitted.
      2. The action attribute specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted.(we use url for submit)
      3. We can use any server side language js, python etc.
      4. When we submit a form in a web application, the data you entered is sent to a backend file (also known as a server-side script). This script is responsible for processing the data. It could save the data in a database, write it to a file, send an email, or perform any other action as per the code written in it. This process is a fundamental part of how web applications work.
